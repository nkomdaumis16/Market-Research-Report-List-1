<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Thrombosis Drug Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>P2Y12 Platelet Inhibitor</li><li>Xa Inhibitor</li><li>Heparin</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The thrombosis drug market includes various types of anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents. P2Y12 platelet inhibitors, such as clopidogrel, prevent platelet aggregation, reducing clot formation in arterial thrombosis. Xa inhibitors, like rivaroxaban and apixaban, inhibit factor Xa to prevent venous thromboembolism and are effective in managing conditions like atrial fibrillation. Heparin, an injectable anticoagulant, enhances the bodyâ€™s natural anticoagulant mechanisms and is used for immediate anticoagulation in various clinical settings. Each type plays a crucial role in managing thrombotic disorders.</p></p>
