<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cardiac Stimulation Leads Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bipolar</li><li>Monopolar</li><li>Quadrupolar</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The cardiac stimulation leads market comprises three main types: bipolar, monopolar, and quadrupolar leads. Bipolar leads connect both the anode and cathode within the heart, providing precise stimulation and minimizing electromagnetic interference. Monopolar leads use a single electrode and rely on a larger reference electrode, allowing for greater range but potentially less targeted delivery. Quadrupolar leads feature four electrodes, offering advanced pacing options and improved myocardial capture, enhancing therapy effectiveness and adaptability in cardiac care.</p></p>
